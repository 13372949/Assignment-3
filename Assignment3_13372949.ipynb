        "        According to the model of The Social Media Analytics Framework (Stieglitz et al., 2014; Stieglitz & Dang-Xuan, 2013), Data is required to perform different operations. Fan and Gordon (2014) proposed a three-step process, which is, capture, understand and present. Based on the three-step process, Stieglitz et al. (2014) also propose a framework for social media analytics. How to properly capture social media data about the topic 'vote' has become one of the challenges.\n",

        "      After determining the steps, we analysed the characteristics of social media data. There are many similarities between social media data and big data. Therefore, I drew on many kinds of literature analysing big data. One solution is to collect data on different platforms by building different models and algorithms. For example, character limitation requires a corresponding algorithm and model, which is consistent with the data extraction of Twitter social media. For the Facebook platform, the staff needs to build another model and algorithm to discover and track new data and collect them. \n",
        "        In the general case of data analysis, most algorithms and models are universal, but in the data analysis of social media, we should establish different data analysis models and algorithms, corresponding to the framework for social media analytics proposed by Stieglitz et al (2014). In the enhanced discovery stage, before tracking data.\n"

The relational database management system is a common data analysis, but according to different social media data collection, traditional structured query language can not meet the needs of big data.\n",

We just have more data.” In social media data, there is data that includes almost any topic from different devices, such as mobile phones, social networks, GPS, etc., and data types may also include more data types like Numbers, words, slang, and different languages. Even in life, each of us produces a statistic called step count. The available data is often unstructured and complex, and it is a difficult challenge to find and apply more efficient data after the NoSQL database has been set up and stored in it.\n",
